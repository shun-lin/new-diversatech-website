# DiversaTech Consulting
We want to connect students of all majors with the technology industry by exposing non-engineering majors to coding curriculum. Our goal is to create an inclusive and collaborative environment for learning computer science while inspiring interdisciplinary students to excel in technology careers through workshops, coding sessions, CS tutoring, and company recruitment events. We want to make learning computer science fun and social, while also exposing students to different avenues for involvement in the tech sector.
